          <b>Body Massage</b><br /><br />
          Massage has different benefits for human health. If massage were to be
          considered as a medicinal formula, it would be widely welcomed by the
          public.
          <br /><br />
          1. Improved sleep<br />
          For those who fall asleep quickly during a massage, this simply makes
          absolute sense. Studies have shown that massage helps to reduce sleep
          disturbances and promotes the "Delta wave" of deep sleep. According to
          a study published in 1998 in the International Journal of
          Neuroscience, migraine sufferers reported a reduction in pain
          symptoms, migraine recurrence and sleep disturbance after a single
          massage session.
          <br /><br />
          2. Pain relief<br />
          Correctly applied pressure from massage can help relax tense muscles
          and improve blood circulation. Massage also improves flexibility, thus
          helping to prevent injuries or strains (especially those caused by
          repetitive strains). A study published in 2011 in the Annals of
          Internal Medicine on the effectiveness of lower back pain treatment
          (for palliative massage, structural massage and other treatments)
          showed that 10 weeks of massage treatment was more effective in
          reducing pain than medication and exercise, and that the effects
          lasted up to six months, while the results for palliative massage and
          structural massage were comparable in effectiveness.
          <br />
          **Structural massage is based on the musculoskeletal and muscular
          structure.
